## Report Description
Report Format: Each report can follow the IMRaD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion). However, you are free to adjust this format as you see fit. Just make sure to mention all necessary details such as the data, models, architectures, etc. A literature review is not required. For citations, you can use either MLA or APA format.

The environment we previously provided does not include all the necessary packages required for the final lab. Ensure each environment is set up correctly before starting each part of the assignment.
