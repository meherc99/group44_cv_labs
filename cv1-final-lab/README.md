# CV1 Final Lab Part 1 & 2

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for **Final Lab** of the **Computer Vision 1** course, part of the **Master's in Artificial Intelligence** program at the **University of Amsterdam**. The lab exercises are designed to deepen your understanding of key computer vision concepts and provide hands-on experience with popular Python libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Overview

Digital cameras are everywhere, embedded in consumer cameras, webcams, mobile phones, and professional equipment. These devices generate vast amounts of data, crucial for communication, observation, and interaction. This course focuses on the computational techniques used to enable computers to understand the visual world, with a particular emphasis on scene understanding and object recognition.

The course covers a wide range of topics, including:
- Image formation and filtering
- Feature extraction (color and shape invariants, interest point detectors, descriptors like SIFT and HoG)
- Visual information representation (vector space, statistical models, Bag-of-Words)
- Learning and classification techniques, including deep learning (DL)
- Object detection and classification, object tracking

## Environment Setup

Students should provide their own Python environment to run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Report Description
Report Format: Each report can follow the IMRaD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion). However, you are free to adjust this format as you see fit. Just make sure to mention all necessary details such as the data, models, architectures, etc. A literature review is not required. For citations, you can use either MLA or APA format.

## Environment
You are required to create two separate computing environments using conda: one for Part 1 and one for Part 2 of the final lab. The environment we previously provided does not include all the necessary packages required for the final lab. Ensure each environment is set up correctly before starting each part of the assignment.
